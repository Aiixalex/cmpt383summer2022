# Racket Notes

More coming soon!


## Installing Racket

Please use the [DrRacket IDE](https://racket-lang.org/). We won't use the
command-line version.

## Coding Style

Racket supports many different languages, and we will be using the core Raket
language. To ensure this, put this line at the top of all your Racket source
files:

```lisp
#lang racket

;; ... your Racket code ...
```

While Racket/Scheme has loops, we are *not* going to be using them in our
discussion of Racket. Instead we will focus on functional programming, a style
of programming pioneered by LISP, and required by Haskell (the language we'll
study after Racket).
